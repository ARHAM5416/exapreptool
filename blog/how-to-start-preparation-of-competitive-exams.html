                <p>
                    Many times we have heard that our 12th grade and the boards are the decisive exam of our lives, but as we grow up we gradually realise that actually it wasn’t. The boards are just the initial move that we need to make in our lives in order to decide the direction in which we are going to move ahead academically. In reality, it was just the beginning of what we call the ‘career’.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If we say that these competitive exams are the decisive exams, then it won’t be much of an absurdity. In many lives these competitive exams play a pivotal role around which their whole world revolves. But why do these exams hold so much water after all? This is because it will be a significant reflection of what we are going to be 5 years or maybe 10 10years be down the line. It’ll decide the status and the standard of life we are going to have in our near future. And this is the reason why many of us go through so much of grilling and gruelling sessions of elongated studies and practices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If these things are so much important then don’t you think that we should be tactical in our approach? As because in this fast moving and utterly advanced era of skilful technology, only hard work is not going to get us through it. As the famous narrative goes- “smart work and not hard work”, yes… we need to have a good blend of hard work and smart work to achieve what we want to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, here we are with some really very helpful and empirically tested ways and tips of smart working along with hard working. And the best part is- it is not limited to any particular exam or situation rather these are broad enough to be applied in almost every walk of life even while dealing with any sort of academic testing.
                </p>

              

            <ol class="list-group-numbered">              
                <li class="mt-5 b-header">Have a 360degree view:</li>
                <p>
                    A smart worker knows it all. By this we mean that before actually getting into the process of preparations we must first of all gather every inch of knowledge of the exam that we’re planning to take. Now, this knowledge would include points like- what the exam is all about, how many stages of screening does it have, how many times a year this exam is held, which body conducts it, what is the pay scale if we clear it, what is the scope for further growth etc.
                </p>

                <li class="mt-4 b-header">Syllabus:</li>
                <p>
                    Syllabus of your exam will play a pivotal role throughout your preparations and until you get it through. Yes, syllabus is one such thing that not only defines the peripheries of your preparations but also tells you in which direction the preparations are supposed to move. Syllabus also allows you to get a good knowledge of the proficiency that this particular demands for. So, thoroughly go through the syllabus first and make sure you are well acquainted with it in advance. Also keep a check on the updates in the syllabus.
                </p>

                <li class="mt-4 b-header">Exam pattern:</li>
                <p>
                    Exam pattern is something that gives you a good insight of how the questions are going to be framed and what their structure will be. Sometimes the syllabus is not that tough but the level of question which are being asked is of a very advanced level, this happens usually in case of practical subjects like mathematics, accounts etc. in case of theoretical concepts you not only need to understand the frame of the question but should also be aware of the correct approach to crack them. For example- nowadays many exams are putting up questions like- assertion and its reason, find out the correct ones, which among the following is wrong etc. so merely cramming the theories is not going to take you anywhere, you should also be aware of its application in real life. Remember the smart working.
                </p>

                <li class="mt-4 b-header">Marking scheme:</li>
                <p>
                    The next thing that has to be followed by the exam pattern is the marking scheme. Marking scheme refers to the pattern of marking. These days in almost all of the exams we’re having negative marking but the proportion of it varies. At times it is one-third or may be one-fourth and like that. So, you need to know how much marks will be given to a correct answer and how much will be deducted for a wrong answer.
                </p>

                <li class="mt-4 b-header">Mode of conduction:</li>
                <p>
                    Mode of exam means that whether the exam will be a computer based exam or an offline exam. You should also check how many shifts the exam will be conducted, what the time frame for every shift and how many questions will be asked in one shift.
                </p>

                <li class="mt-4 b-header">Previous year question papers:</li>
                <p>
                    Previous year question papers are like treasure to the aspirants. It tells you everything that you need to know about the questions and the level of the exam. In a true sense it is a good spirit of your exam. Many a time it is being witnessed that concepts and even the questions are being repeated from the previous year papers. All you need to do is look out for the best reliable and authenticated publication book of sample paper for your exam and make sure you purchase it. Beware while buying the previous year question papers booklet because if the publications are not trustworthy then there are chances that the answers which are marked are wrong, it can negatively affect your preparations and your morale too. Nowadays the previous year papers are also available on the official websites of the conducting agencies but simultaneously make sure that you also arrange the right answer key for the same.
                </p>

                <li class="mt-4 b-header">Books and study material:</li>
                <p>
                    Nowadays books for every sort of competitive exam are available in the market in abundance. It is your job to make sure that you buy books of trusted writers or of authenticated publications because a lot of people are out there just to make  money, don’t fall in their trap. You can look out for the ratings of any particular book on the internet, after all, the world is at your tips. If you don’t want to refer to any hard material then you can also access the online sources which are out there to impart paid or free knowledge regarding the same exam that you’re preparing for.
                </p>

                <li class="mt-4 b-header">Note making:</li>
                <p>
                    Please do not avoid this thing. Notes will be your weapons as well as your backups that would help you get through. Often, making notes is a very time absorbing task but please do not procrastinate it. It’ll help you not only in memorising and revising time and again but will also help you in final days right before the exam, then you won’t be required to wander around in the search of notes rather, you will be having your own. These notes will help you throughout your life even after the exams because the knowledge is never outdated.
                </p>

                <li class="mt-4 b-header">Practicing mocks:</li>
                <p>
                    This is one of those crucial things that smart people do. Yes, taking up mocks and practice sets throughout your preparations will not only tell you how well you are improving but will also reveal your strengths and weak area wherein you need to work within the given time frame. Mocks are available on many of the educational websites, platforms and apps. Many a time it is even free of cost. Now, the main thing that you need to keep in mind is don’t go on taking the mocks, yes, after every mock analyse it, go through the mistakes that you’ve committed and work build upon them so that you never commit the same mistake again. Analysing the mocks is must.
                </p>

                <li class="mt-4 b-header">Keep visiting the official website:</li>
                <p>
                    This is an additional task which will give your preparations and edge. You should keep visiting the official of your exam in order to keep abreast of changes (if made any), regarding the release of application forms, admit cards and ultimately- the results.
                </p>



                <p class="mt-2">Hopefully these tips will help you in getting a good head start of your exam. Just try these religiously and you’ll be able to keep your preparations in good shape.</p>
